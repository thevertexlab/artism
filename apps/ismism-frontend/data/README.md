## How to Use

### Adding Images

For each art movement, you can add related images in the corresponding folder:

1. Navigate to the appropriate folder, e.g., `images/impressionism/`
2. Save images in the format `[Artist Name]_[Artwork Name].jpg`

### Using Data

You can use this data in the following ways:

```javascript
// Read art style data
const artStyles = require('./data/artStyles.json');

// Read connection data
const connections = require('./data/connections.json');

// Display specific style information
const impressionism = artStyles.find(style => style.id === 'impressionism');
console.log(impressionism.title);  // Output: Impressionism
```
